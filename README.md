# This repository contains the code for an animated website built using React, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP for animations.

#Project Overview
#This project aims to create a visually appealing website with dynamic animations to enhance user experience. To achieve this goal, the development process is divided into several steps:

1.Problem Breakdown: Initially, the project's requirements and desired features are analyzed to break down the tasks into smaller, manageable components. This helps in better organization and understanding of the development process.

2.Component Building: Following the principles of component-based architecture, different parts of the website are developed as reusable components. Each component focuses on a specific functionality or UI element, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

3.GSAP Integration: GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) is utilized to add animations to various elements of the website. GSAP provides powerful tools for creating smooth, performant animations with ease, enhancing the overall user experience.

4.Tailwind CSS Styling: Tailwind CSS is employed for styling the components and layout of the website. Tailwind's utility-first approach allows for rapid development and easy customization of styles, resulting in a consistent and visually appealing design.
